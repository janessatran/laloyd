# Welcome
A no-fuss, functional (yet modern) looking theme for jekyll sites. It includes a few accessibility features including:
  + Hidden skip link to main content
  + Focus states
  + High contrast colors
  + Accessible syntax highlighting
  + Structural, semantic HTML

## Inspiration
This theme was inspired by my cat Lloyd, otherwise known as "La-Loyd".
